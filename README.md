# Fraud Vision

Fraud Vision is a vital application in the financial sector aimed at identifying fraudulent transactions to protect both consumers and financial institutions. This project leverages the capabilities of Streamlit, a powerful open-source app framework, to build an interactive and intuitive web application that enables users to detect and analyze fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time.

User-Friendly Interface: The application provides an easy-to-navigate interface for users to upload datasets, view transaction details, and receive instant fraud detection results.
Real-Time Analysis: Streamlit's dynamic nature allows for real-time data analysis and visualization, making it easier to identify fraudulent patterns and anomalies.
Machine Learning Integration: The project integrates machine learning models trained to detect fraudulent transactions based on historical data. These models can be updated and improved over time to enhance detection accuracy.
Interactive Data Visualization: Users can explore transaction data through interactive plots and charts, enabling a deeper understanding of fraud trends and patterns.
Customizable Detection Parameters: The application allows users to adjust detection parameters and thresholds to fine-tune the fraud detection process according to specific requirements.
